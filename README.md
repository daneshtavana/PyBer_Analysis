# PyBer_Analysis

Module 5 UCBerkeley Extension "Pandas and Jupyter Notebook" with Anaconda Python3.7

The purpose of the module is to review raw data from PyBer, a ride-sharing startup, to anlyze key metric.

Bar charts, Box charts and Pie charts provided the visuals to the CEO of the ride sharing company PyBer results. Six images and Figures provide a comprehensive summary of the analysis.

Some of the observations from the summary chart include:

Fig 1 PyBer Ride Sharing Scatter chart indicates:
       a) Highest volume of riders in urban center pay the lowest fares
       d) Lowest vooume of riders in rural areas pay the hihest fares
       c) Suburbean are in between

Fig 2-4 PyBer Box charts shows Min. Max, Stdev, Mean, Outlier statisitcs for city type's:
       a) Riders
       d) Fares
       c) Drivers

Fig 5-7 PyBer Pie charts shows relative sizes of the folowing categfories by city type:
       a) Riders
       d) Fares
       c) Drivers
       
The greatest challenge I encountered was with the second challege question? I could not find a way to create the dataframe and plot the line charts. It would be a good idea to review the challenge problem early in the week in order to spend more time researhcing solutions.

I spent too uch time on the module course material. Unfortunately, there were no exampokes in the modules to help with the answers to the second challenge question.

Based on the data from the different city types, I would recommend to the CEO to experiment if hiring more drivers and lowering the fares in rural area would provide additional revenue?
